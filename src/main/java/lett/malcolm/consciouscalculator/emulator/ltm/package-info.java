/**
 * This package holds logic related to Long Term Memory.
 * 
 * Within this emulator, Long Term Memory represents a number of things:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Pre-programmed and learned concepts and facts  -- this is the primary purpose of LTM
 * <li> Long memory of history                         -- secondary purpose of LTM
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Pre-programmed concepts and facts are represented in a mixture of generic LTM representation,
 * and hard-coded for practical simplicity.
