/**
 * This package holds pre-programmed concepts and facts that are accessible within Long Term Memory.
 * 
 * Many of the facts here are also pre-programmed into Processors, as pre-learned behaviour
 * that no longer needs the LTM reference.
 * 
 * However, the LTM reference can still be used when needed for higher-order reasoning.
 * 
 * <h3>Code-level Access to Pre-programmed Concepts</h3>
 * Processors don't necessarily need to directly load and use Fact instances,
 * because many processors represent learned rapid evaluation of WM state.
 * Thus they do not need to access LTM.
 * 
 * But when high-order processing is required, that processing may need to go
 * back to base principles, and to access the linked original concept.
 * 
 * Thus rapid evaluation processors may access internal classes directly,
 * without going via instances of the fact.
