/**
 * This is a quick'n'nasty solution for the rest of the tasks needed to solve partially parsed expressions.
 * Prerequisites: requires that WM is populated by some remembered concepts that can help us infer the meaning of
 * the unknown expression component. 
 * 
 * Infers unknown expression and equation tokens, based on concepts present within WM.
 * eg: "3 + ? = 8"
 * 
 * At the time this first kicks in, WM will be in a state as follows (in an example WM strength order):
 * <ul>
 * <li> StuckThoughtEvent (ref=TextRequestEvent)
 * <li> TextRequestEvent "3 + ? = 8" (REQUEST,HANDLED)
 * <li> MemoryEvent with eventData containing a list of Percepts: NumberFact, EquationFact, OperatorFact, ExpressionTokenFact, EquationOperatorFact  (ref=MemorySearchRequestEvent)
 * <li> MemorySearchRequestEvent with contents of PerceptEvent (HANDLED,ref=PerceptEvent)
 * <li> PerceptEvent holding partially-parsed Equation: Number(3) Operator(+) ExpressionToken(?) EquationOperator(=) Number(8)  (ref=TextRequestEvent)
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Known Event types acted on by the this processor:
 * - {@link PerceptEvent}
