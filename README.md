# Research into Consciousness
This site is a collection of theoretical works on the mechanisms behind consciousness and conscious experience, and it is a software emulation of some of those mechanisms.
The site has three parts...


# Theory
Discussions on theoretical background are available from here:
* [Theory Home](https://github.com/toaomalkster/conscious-calculator/wiki/Theory-Home)


# Design
Design documents behind the software emulation of consciousness mechanisms are available from the "Design" section of navigation box within the site [wiki](https://github.com/toaomalkster/conscious-calculator/wiki). In particular, see:
* [Architecture Overview](https://github.com/toaomalkster/conscious-calculator/wiki/Architecture-Overview)


# Emulation of Consciousness - The Conscious Calculator
Conscious Calculator is an application that attempts to emulate consciousness.
* Attempts to emulate consciousness, but at the level of intelligence of a calculator.
* Currently written in Java, but there are plans to replace this with a neural network.

**Website (Deprecated):**
The code and website here represent older ideas, and aren't worth looking at. Please see the theoretical background in the wiki instead. A new neural network based solution that incorporates my latest ideas is being worked on. The [old test site](https://conscious-calculator.herokuapp.com) is available on Heroku. It's hosted under a free-tier, which goes to sleep during inactivity, so it may take a few seconds to start. Login credentials are `letmein` for both username and password.

**Running Locally or Hosting:**
Environment configuration properties required for running in prod:

    LOGIN_USERNAME     - single login credentials username
    LOGIN_PASSWORD     - single login credentials password
